I've owned a few phone in my time but the s22ultra exynos2200 would be the worst I've had. the only thing decent about this phone is the screen, gets plenty bright, and looks good, and surfing the internet is smooth, everything else is basic. .120Hz refresh rate isn't noticeable compared to 90Hz, more a gimmick to justify a price hike. it gets hot and I mean hot and the battery drains real fast, it lags, Samsung software is annoying with notification after notification, no way turn it offonly limit, in settings. the cameras are a disappointment, I've played around with different settings, pro mode, etc and the cameras suck. photos are hit and miss, everything looks artificial, night time photos are noisy and basic, zoom in and it struggles to focus, keep taping that screen, updates have not improved much, photos now overexposed, daytime video is pretty good, 4k 60 or 8k 30, prefer 4k. I'm not impressed by the camera. comparing it to a P40 pro plus camera, the s22ultra cannot compete in quality especially night time photos. the s pen, I've used it twice, I wouldn't recommend the s22 ultra, buy it and you will have regrets. I paid $1449 for this handful of junk and the price has gone up to over $1800, the s22 ultra at those prices is nothing more than a rip off. mobile phones aren't getting better they are getting more expensive for the same junk year after year. There are no happy S22 owners, the phone is a mid range over hyped into a, flagship. let's get real.
